FreeRTOS utilities for developers using libhal.

> [!INFO]
> The versions of this project are not associated with FreeRTOS. This package
> will aim to support the latest version of FreeRTOS that is provided by the
> `libhal/freertos` package.
>
> If we determine that there is demand for specific version of FreeRTOS and not
> just the latest, then we may consider a change in version control. What that
> looks like is not well defined currently.
